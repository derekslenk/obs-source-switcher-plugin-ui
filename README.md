This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app to control multiple OBS [Source Switchers](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/source-switcher.941/)

This expects the files `large.txt`, `left.txt`, and `right.txt` to exist in `C:\OBS\source-switching`. This will be more easily configured in an upcoming iteration

`npm install` and 
`npm run dev` to run it.
